  		<!-- 'Description' -->
  		<span id = "description"><div class = "title">How to Play</div><br>Minesweeper is a single-player game, in which the objective of the game is clear to clear the entire board without revealing any hidden mines which are randomly scattered across the board. Tiles will contain the number of neighbouring mines surrounding them <span class = "tileInfo">( i.e. the 8 mines around the tile which are touching that mine )</span>, which are used as clues to avoid or flag mines. Hitting a mine whilst playing will subsequently result in a loss and once all tiles except mines have been revealed, the game is won.</span>
       </div>


      <div class = "body">

      <!-- 'Revealing a tile' -->
      <span id = "sub1"> <div class ="title">Revealing a Tile : </div><br>A tile can be revealed through a mousepress (Left or Right Click). If a blank tile is selected, then all neighbouring blank tiles will be revealed along with it :</span>

		<!-- 'Flagging / Unflagging a Tile' -->
      <span id = "sub2"> <div class = "title">Flagging / Unflagging a Tile : </div><br> Hover the mouse over the tile you wish to flag / unflag. To place a flag press the 'X' key and to remove the flag press the 'Z' key on the keyboard. Once a flag is placed, the tile will not be revealed once clicked on, any identified mines should be flagged as visual guidance and to prevent the game from being lost (for reasons such as misclicks etc). </span>

      <!-- 'How to find Mines' -->
      <span id = "sub3"> <div class = "title"> How to Find Mines </div><br> Numbered tiles will represent how many mines are surrounding that tile (the 8 tiles that surround the mine), or in other words the square which surrounds the numbered tile. The image on the right may help in understanding this concept which is essential to be able to play the game. </span>

      <span id = "sub4"> <div class = "title"> Score Functionality </div><br> The score is displayed above the game board. For any tile that is revealed that isn't a mine, the player will recieve 1 score. If the game is won, the user recieves an additional 50 points. The score will additionally display if the game is lost or won as can be seen : </span>
