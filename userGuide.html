  		<!-- 'Description' -->
  		<span id = "description"><div class = "title">About Minesweeper</div><br>Minesweeper is a single-player game. The objective is to clear the entire board without revealing  any hidden mines. Mines are scattered randomly across the board. Revealed tiles will contain the number of neighbouring mines surrounding them (if any) which are used as clues to avoid or flag mines (see below). Hitting a mine whilst in play will result in the game ending. Revealing all tiles except mines will result in winning the game.</span>

      <div class = "body">

      <!-- 'Revealing a tile' -->
      <span id = "sub1"> <div class ="title">Revealing a Tile</div><br>A tile can be revealed through a mousepress (Left or Right Click). If a blank tile is selected, then all neighbouring blank tiles will be revealed along with it. </span>

		<!-- 'Flagging / Unflagging a Tile' -->
      <span id = "sub2"> <div class = "title">Flagging / Unflagging a Tile</div><br> You can flag a tile to indicate there is a mine there. Hover the mouse over the tile you wish to flag / unflag. To place a flag press the 'X' key and to remove the flag press the 'Z' key on the keyboard. Once a flag is placed, the tile will not be revealed once clicked on. Any identified mines should be flagged as visual guidance and to prevent the game from being lost (for reasons such as misclicks etc). </span>

      <!-- 'How to find Mines' -->
      <span id = "sub3"> <div class = "title"> How to Find Mines </div><br> Numbered tiles will represent how many mines are surrounding that tile (the 8 tiles that surround the mine), or in other words the square which surrounds the numbered tile. The image on the right may help in understanding this concept which is essential to be able to play the game. </span>

      <span id = "sub4"> <div class = "title"> Score Functionality </div><br> The score is displayed above the game board. For any tile that is revealed that isn't a mine, the player will recieve 1 point. If the game is won, the user recieves an additional 50 points. The score will display if the game is lost or won as can be seen.</span>
